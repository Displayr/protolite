Title: Fast and Simple Object Serialization to Protocol Buffers
Author: Jeroen Ooms
Maintainer: Jeroen Ooms <jeroen@berkeley.edu>
Description: Optimized C++ implementations for reading and writing protocol-buffers.
    Currently supports 'rexp.proto' for serializing R objects and 'geobuf.proto' for
    geojson data. This lightweight package is complementary to the much larger
    'RProtoBuf' package which provides a full featured toolkit for working with
    protocol-buffers in R.
